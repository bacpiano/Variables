//: ## Variables Exercises
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
### Exercise 1

For each of the following names and types, create a variables or constant that best represents it:

- boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius (Double)
- gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
- naturalLogarithmicBase (Double)
- ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
- studentNickname (String)
*/

var biolingPointOfWaterInCelsius: Double = 100
var gallonsRemainingInTank: Double = 5.4
var naturalLogarithmicBase: Double = 10.0
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: Int = 4
var studentNickname: String = "sebastian bach"

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: Character = "s"
gallonsRemainingInTank = 2
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let _numberOfGasIcons: Double = gallonsRemainingInTank
var numberOfPolygonsInModel = 30
numberOfPolygonsInModel = 32
var polygonsLeftToDraw = 0
polygonsLeftToDraw = numberOfPolygonsInModel

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to invalid names:
var nameOfSchool = "Udacity"
var schoolClass = "Math"
let important = "Nissian"
var 🐩myDog = "🐶"
var 🐕yourDog = "🐶"
